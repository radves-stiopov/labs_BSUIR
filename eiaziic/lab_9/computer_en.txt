Scientific papers in computer science are the primary source of information about new algorithms and neural network architectures. Before being published in a reputable journal, every paper undergoes a rigorous peer-review process by experts in the field. Most modern research focuses on deep learning methods and big data processing. The "Methodology" section of a paper describes the software development and testing process in detail. Correct formatting of citations and references is critically important for maintaining academic ethics. Publishing in the proceedings of "A*" level conferences is considered highly prestigious among developers and scientists. The abstract of a paper should briefly reflect the core problem, the proposed solution, and the results obtained. Many authors make the source code of their experiments publicly available to ensure research reproducibility. Theoretical papers often contain complex mathematical proofs of algorithmic correctness. Analyzing recent publications helps specialists track current trends in the information technology industry.
